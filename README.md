App for determining the appropriate thickness of glass used in buildings in different regions of the country
The following design considerations have been followed in determination of the appropriate thickness of glass in the App:

1.Maximum area of glass panel is restricted to 15.0 m2.

2.Maximum span of window is restricted to 4.0 m. 

3.Aspect ratio of the glass panel is greater than 1.5. If it is less than 1.5, next   higher available thickness shall is to be selected. 

4.Factor of safety used is 2.5 considering the variability in strength of glass.
